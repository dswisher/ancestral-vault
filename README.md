# Ancestral Vault

This project aims to store family history data as plain text files, for long-term preservation.
For a data model, I am attempting to use the GenTech Data Model.

* [GenTech Data Model 1.1](https://www.ngsgenealogy.org/wp-content/uploads/NGS-History/Description_GENTECH_Data_Model_1.1.doc) - a word doc that describes the model
    * I converted this to PDF and saved a copy in the [docs directory](docs/gentech-data-model-1.1.pdf)
    * There is an [ERD available](https://www.ngsgenealogy.org/wp-content/uploads/NGS-History/Diagram_GENTECH_Data_Model_1.0.pdf), which I also saved into the [docs directory](docs/gentech-erd-1.0.pdf)
* [Geneapro](https://github.com/briot/geneapro) - Genealogical software based on the GenTech data model - written in Python - last change in Jan-2023
    * There is some discussion in their [wiki](https://github.com/briot/geneapro/wiki), on the [Gentech page](https://github.com/briot/geneapro/wiki/Gentech)
    * It mentions a page that describes [citing sources](http://jytangledweb.org/genealogy/evidencestyle/)
* [GenTech Primer](https://genealogy.sourceforge.net/GENTECH_Primer.html) - a page on Sourceforge - I printed the page and saved it as a PDF in the [docs directory](docs/gentech-primer.pdf)
    * The page has some examples of encoding data in the model that are illustrative
* [GDMXML](http://gdmxml.fugal.net/) - an XML implementation of the Genealogical Data Model.
    * The site includes a sample, which I saved in the [docs directory](docs/fugl.xml)
* [GenTech UML](https://freepages.rootsweb.com/~mitchellsharp/history/gdmref/gentech-gdm.html) - a 3rd-party recasting of the GDM model in UML, includes a PDF with some possibly useful info
