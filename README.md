# Ancestral Vault

This project aims to store family history data as plain text files, for long-term preservation.


## Data Model

I looked extensively at the GenTech data model, and it is too complex for some things, too flexible in some ways, and too vague in other areas.
It has many great ideas, though, that I have incorporated into my data model.

* [GenTech Data Model 1.1](https://www.ngsgenealogy.org/wp-content/uploads/NGS-History/Description_GENTECH_Data_Model_1.1.doc) - a word doc that describes the model
    * I converted this to PDF and saved a copy in the [docs directory](docs/gentech-data-model-1.1.pdf)
    * There is an [ERD available](https://www.ngsgenealogy.org/wp-content/uploads/NGS-History/Diagram_GENTECH_Data_Model_1.0.pdf), which I also saved into the [docs directory](docs/gentech-erd-1.0.pdf)
* [Geneapro](https://github.com/briot/geneapro) - Genealogical software based on the GenTech data model - written in Python - last change in Jan-2023
    * There is some discussion in their [wiki](https://github.com/briot/geneapro/wiki), on the [Gentech page](https://github.com/briot/geneapro/wiki/Gentech)
    * It mentions a page that describes [citing sources](http://jytangledweb.org/genealogy/evidencestyle/)
* [GenTech Primer](https://genealogy.sourceforge.net/GENTECH_Primer.html) - a page on Sourceforge - I printed the page and saved it as a PDF in the [docs directory](docs/gentech-primer.pdf)
    * The page has some examples of encoding data in the model that are illustrative
* [GDMXML](http://gdmxml.fugal.net/) - an XML implementation of the Genealogical Data Model.
    * The site includes a sample, which I saved in the [docs directory](docs/fugl.xml)
* [GenXML](https://www.cosoft.org/genxml/) - a file format for exchange of data between genealogy programs - somewhat based on GenTech model - version 3 of the spec is in the [docs directory](docs/genxml-3.0.pdf)
* [GenTech UML](https://freepages.rootsweb.com/~mitchellsharp/history/gdmref/gentech-gdm.html) - a 3rd-party recasting of the GDM model in UML, includes a PDF with some possibly useful info
