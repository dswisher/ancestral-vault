# TODOs

* Rather than creating EVENT-TYPEs, EVENT-ROLE-TYPEs, and PLACE-TYPEs in an admin section, create those internally, as the code relies on them.
    * Use constants in the code, rather than magic strings scattered throughout the code and vault.
    * Replace "bride" and "groom" with "partner1" and "partner2"
